Determination of the multiple crack parameters in self-healing process of asphalt mixture based on the contactless nonlinear ultrasonic

Second harmonic generation (SHG) technique, which belongs to one of the nonlinear ultrasonic techniques (NUTs), 
is widely recognized for its high sensitivity in detecting material damage across various fields. However, 
accurately determining multiple critical crack parameters in materials remains a complex challenge that cannot be resolved by relying solely 
on a single nonlinear parameter. In this study, SHG technique and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (SHG-BLSTM) is 
combined to address the ill-posed inverse problem of identifying multiple parameters involved in the self-healing process of a
sphalt mixture. Specifically, 95% of the ultrasonic signals were obtained through numerical simulation,
while the remaining 5% were acquired via air-coupling experiments. This hybrid dataset serves as the foundation for predicting multiple crack parameters, 
including crack length and crack width. The predicted results are highly accurate and closely match the target values. Two novel approaches are 
introduced to elucidate the high accuracy of the predictions: decomposed sequences and SHAP values. The analysis of decomposed sequences indicates 
that high-frequency signals contribute minimally to the predictions. Meanwhile, SHAP values reveal that the primary contributions to the predictions 
come from the fundamental signal and the second harmonic signal. This finding aligns with the principles of SHG technique in characterizing material damage. 
Finally, the robustness of the SHG-BLSTM is evaluated under conditions of imbalanced datasets and noise interference. 
SHG-BLSTM performs exceptionally well in these tests, demonstrating its resilience and reliability. In conclusion, SHG-BLSTM proves to be an effective approach 
for determining multiple ill-posed parameters in the damage process of materials.
