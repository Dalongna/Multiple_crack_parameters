Abstract: 

The second harmonic generation (SHG) technique, is one of the nonlinear ultrasonic techniques (NUTs), is widely recognized for its high sensitivity in detecting material damage across various fields. However, accurately determining multiple critical crack parameters in materials remains a complex challenge that cannot be resolved by relying solely on a single nonlinear parameter. In this study, SHG technique and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (SHG-BLSTM) are combined to address the ill-posed inverse problem of identifying multiple parameters involved in the self-healing process of asphalt mixture. The hybrid dataset, which was obtained through numerical simulation and air-coupling experiments, serves as the foundation for predicting multiple crack parameters, including crack length and crack width. The predicted results are highly accurate and closely match the target values. Two novel approaches are introduced to elucidate the high accuracy of the predictions: decomposed sequences and SHAP values. The decomposed sequences indicate that high-frequency signals contribute minimally to the predictions. Meanwhile, SHAP values reveal that the primary contributions to the predictions come from the fundamental signal and the second harmonic signal. This finding aligns with the principles of the SHG technique in characterizing material damage. Finally, the robustness of the SHG-BLSTM is evaluated under conditions of imbalanced datasets and noise interference. SHG-BLSTM performs exceptionally well in these tests, demonstrating its resilience and reliability. In conclusion, SHG-BLSTM model proves to be an effective approach for determining multiple ill-posed parameters in the damage process of materials.
